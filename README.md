## Plan
The plan that I have is to create an agent that will help me create meaningful, uplifting, and philosophical posts by using artificial inteligence to search a text and find something syntactically associated with a certain Idea or question. The agents involvment could be minor (finding semantically similar ideas and return page rows), moderate (both finding relavant text and also recommending possible places or free books to find text as well as creating an image or cartoon that represents that), to major (total post creation, suggestion, and submission. The only thing left for the human to do would be to press "post") 
## Requirements

1. Have the agent be able to perform a google search "with my temp google account" for topic relavent pdfs
2. Have the agent be able to search through a given text
3. Have the agent be able to generate relevant image for post
4. Have the agent be able to access facebook account
5. Have the agent be able to access twitter account
6. Have the user be able to specify involvment level
7. Have the user be able to specify image theme/themes (e.g. cartoon, anime, cowboy, realistic)
8. Have the user be able to input their own text into the app to be submitted (ai might use this to make an image but won't otherwise handle or alter the data it will simply be given a key to access it)
9. Have the user be able to look at the agentic calls/logs to see what functions that it used and why
10. Get real time data from the ai agent or rather a contiuous stream of data
    

## Functions

1. Search the internet based on a user defined prompt
2. Pull up a specific site and parse the textual information against a given prompt
3. reference an image generation ai to generate images based on text
4. paste given post into social media sites (facebook and twitter) user confrmation needed
5. Also I don't know if this counts but a place to ask for conformation or validation? ie follow up from the user about any of its inputs

## Pages

1. A page to specify post themes. ie religeous philosophical inspirational financial You should be able to store multiple and upon starting a post you select which one you want to use.
2. A page to manage facebook and twitter accounts putting their login in as well as providing a link to the default accounts in app (not logged in)
3. A page to start a post including prompting for additional context if required
4. A view to look at generated images as well as being able to write or modify accompanying text.
5. A view to look at final post (image with accompanying texts or hashtags) as well as a button to post it
6. A page to look at the agentic logs
7. A page to specify AI involvment as well as check/uncheck certain features that you want the ai to perform
8. A view to specify image themes or use a custom collection of themes
9. A page to manage collections of image themes
10. A page to manage source materials including links to pdf articles or internet articles (html pages)
11. A page to donate to the agentic creator (me I want money)
