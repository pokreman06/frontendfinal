## Plan
The plan that I have is to create an agent that will help me create meaningful, uplifting, and philosophical posts by using artificial inteligence to search a text and find something syntactically associated with a certain Idea or question. The agents involvment could be minor (finding semantically similar ideas and return page rows), moderate (both finding relavant text and also recommending possible places or free books to find text as well as creating an image or cartoon that represents that), to major (total post creation, suggestion, and submission. The only thing left for the human to do would be to press "post")
